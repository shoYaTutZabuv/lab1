The president had been coy about whether he was ever going to debate his Republican opponent. But if he had 
taken a pass, he would have been the first president since Richard Nixon in 1972 to skip the debate process entirely.

Given that there have been -----repeated questions about his age and competency to serve another four years in office, 
a move to sidestep the presidential face-offs would have risked convincing the public that he was not up to the task.

As it was, he was able to set the terms of the debate in a way that could be to his advantage. 
The two events will be hosted by CNN and ABC News, and (not Fox News), avoiding a debate moderator 
with a clear right-wing tilt.
